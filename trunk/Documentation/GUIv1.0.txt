GUI:

Status: 
Incomplete.

IMPLEMENTED:

1. Basic frame.
2. File, Tool, Control, Session empty listings in the MenuBar. No listeners attached.
3. Toolbar with icons.
4. Chat panel with tabs (easily removed if they're not needed).
5. Eastern chat panel is implemented by not complete. User list is not implemented.
6. Southern IP status bar currently shows a dummy string address.


NOT IMPLEMENTED: 
(either completely or not fully implemented)

1. Login screen (though there is a fine example of one)
2. User list
3. Chat panel needs to be removable
4. Font/Color in the southern border
5. Chat text input and send button


TO-DO:
Currently the only completely working and stable version has everything in the main class method. This is actively being moved outside of the one class method but is not done. 

Also need to implement the chat text box and user list. In the stable version this is just a tab. In the non-stable version it's in the process of being upgraded to a moveable box.

Additionally need to add the font/color bar to the SOUTH border.
